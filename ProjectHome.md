My Soft synthesizer application experimentation, using midi input to control and generate sounds and music. Can generate music in real time when it's in a good mood. The project kept on growing adding more and more features but stability faultered. Eventually I had to start from scratch and begin a new project that I called "Nestla". A screen-shot and a short description of Nestla in Swedish can be found here: http://lappsidan.eu/torbjornsoderberg/index.html#nestla.
